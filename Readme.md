VoiceClone: Chat with Your Loved Ones
=====================================

Overview
--------

VoiceClone is an AI-powered application that allows users to recreate and interact with the voices of their loved ones who have passed away. Using advanced voice cloning technology from ElevenLabs and a conversational AI system, the project enables meaningful voice-based interactions, preserving memories and emotional connections.

Features
--------

*   **Voice Cloning:** Accurately replicates a person's voice from existing audio samples.
    
*   **Conversational AI:** Enables users to chat in real-time with the cloned voice.
    
*   **Emotional Connection:** Provides a comforting way to remember and interact with lost loved ones.
    
*   **Text-to-Speech Integration:** Users can type messages and hear responses in the cloned voice.
    
*   **Secure & Private:** Ensures user data is encrypted and securely stored.
